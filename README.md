# Ross-Lloyd--Udacity-Robotics-ND-Map-My-World

Packages used in the Udacity Map My World project. 

I submitted a custom created gazebo world and custom virtual robot design with original assets, and used them to create maps with the rtabmap package.

I also designed and built (using custom CAD designed, then 3D printed and lathe-turned aluminium parts) a real robot for use with rtabmap, a differential drive robot using the kinect2 and rplidar A1 sensors, as well as wheel odometry, to create maps of a real world space.
